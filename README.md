# ❄️ 2021-React
Hi. Welcome to my React learning Forest. 
I'm currently building react skills through video tutorials so that I can build a web app using AI models.

## Current project
#### 📚: [Children's book catalogue page](https://github.com/Coding-Forest/2021-React/tree/main/Mini%20Project%201%20Book%20Catalogue)
- Below image is the design of my catalogue page.
- Each book info card carries a hyperlink that opens the corresponding book pages on Amazon.com
